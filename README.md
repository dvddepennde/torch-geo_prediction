## Project Description
This project focuses on classifying land cover types using geospatial data, predicting land cover changes, and performing clustering to identify similar land cover regions. Standard machine learning algorithms are used for this purpose, utilizing techniques such as Cross Validation and Data Augmentation.

##Â Project Description

The main objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to solve three key tasks related to land cover:
* Land Cover Classification: Using geospatial data, predictive models are trained to classify different land cover types.
